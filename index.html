                Little Green Men is a Unity based game around space travel 
                to the planet Mars. Our target audience is softly focused on 
                students in middle and high school. This will allow us to 
                strengthen core physics concepts in youth while not being 
                annoying to adults who have not studied space exploration.

        <div class="game-reason">
            <p>
                Space travel has notoriously been too expensive and too 
                dangerous to send humans on a months long, interplanetary 
                mission to mars. However, with a renewed and energetic interest 
                in private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin a trip to Mars 
                for by the average person is becoming a realistic possibility 
                in our lifetime. This implies a need for enhanced educational 
                tools in educating the next generation of astronauts, 
                scientists, and engineers. The United States has been rejecting 
                science and pushing researchers aside for years which is 
                detrimental to our society as a whole. To ensure the United 
                States is not ignorant on the basics of science, we must begin 
                educating the youth while reinforcing the education through 
                examples of applications.

                    Hi. I'm Ivan Jaramillo, a computer science undergrad at 
                    the College of Wooster participating in the pre-engineering 
                    program for mechanical engineering. I like to skateboard, 
                    work out, and play with robots. I did the website for this 
                    project.

                    Hi, I'm Tanaka Chingonzo, a computer science major at The 
                    College of Wooster. I like to play games, watch TV, read 
                    scifi novels and hike. I have a career interest in Software 
                    Engineering and I built the minigames in the project.
