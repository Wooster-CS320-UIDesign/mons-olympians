        <p>
            Space travel has notoriously been too expensive and too dangerous to send humans on a months long, interplanetary mission to mars. However, with a renewed and energetic interest in private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin a trip to Mars for by the average person is becoming a realistic possibility in our lifetime. This implies a need for enhanced educational tools in educating the next generation of astronauts, scientists, and engineers. The United States has been rejecting science and pushing researchers aside for years which is detrimental to our society as a whole. To ensure the United States is not ignorant on the basics of science, we must begin educating the youth while reinforcing the education through examples of applications.

            Little Green Men is a game about a crew’s travel to Mars. Players can select the ship they want to use and the crew that will go on the ship. From there players must watch their ship’s diagnostics and play mini games to keep the mission going fine.
