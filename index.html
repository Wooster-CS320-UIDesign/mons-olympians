            <h3>What This Project Is</h3>
            <p>
                This is a Unity-based game that tries to be the space version 
                of The Oregon Trail.

                Our target audience is softly focused on students in middle 
                and high school. This will allow us to strengthen core physics 
                concepts in youth while not being annoying to adults who have 
                not studied space exploration. The United States has been 
                rejecting science and pushing researchers aside for years which 
                is detrimental to our society as a whole. To ensure the United 
                States is not ignorant on the basics of science, we must begin 
                educating the youth while reinforcing the education through 
                examples of applications.

            <h3>Why This Project Matters</h3>
            <p>
                Space travel has notoriously been too expensive and too 
                dangerous to send humans on a months long, interplanetary 
                mission to mars. However, with a renewed and energetic interest 
                in private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin a trip to Mars 
                for by the average person is becoming a realistic possibility 
                in our lifetime. This implies a need for enhanced educational 
                tools in educating the next generation of astronauts, 
                scientists, and engineers.
