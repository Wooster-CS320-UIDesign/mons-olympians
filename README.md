Space travel has notoriously been too expensive and too dangerous to send
humans on a months long, interplanetary mission to mars. However, with
a renewed and energetic interest in private companies like SpaceX and
Blue Origin a trip to Mars for by the average person is becoming a
realistic possibility in our lifetime. This implies a need for enhanced
educational tools in educating the next generation of astronauts,
scientists, and engineers. Research spanning over years in the field of
education has shown that video games are an excellent medium to teach.

This is why Tanaka Chingonzo, Jack De la Cruz, and Ivan Jaramillo have
teamed up to create an educational and fun video game about going to
Mars while the player takes care of the crew and the rocket ship.
